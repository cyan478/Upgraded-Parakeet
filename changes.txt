Changes made to Hang Out, from design document to finish product:
- Idea: nothing was removed from the concept but we added extra
	functionality, by incorporating the Wunderground API to help
	users plan their event trip by having an idea of what the
	weather will be like.
	
- Details: We chose not to let users make their own events as it
	felt redundant and not as core to what we wanted to accompish.
	We also have slightly different filters for events than what
	we had initially thought due to TM query options.
	
- Site Map and Component Map: Pretty similar to our original map, main
	difference being that we opted to have a page for each event
	showing more info instead of putting all that info on the main page.
	Got rid of having multiple profile templates and simply use the
	same one for all profile display.

-Database Schema: Found no need for table UserEvents as we had gotten rid
	of those. Created a database for notifications (user, message, datetime)
