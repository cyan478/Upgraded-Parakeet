##What is Hang Out?
Hang Out is a web app that helps people find interesting events near them as well as
make friends interested in similar events. It incorporates the TicketMaster Discovery
API to find events and details of them, the Wunderground API and the Google Maps
Directions API to help users plan their trip to the event (what the weather will be
like and how they can go there). It keeps track of what events users show interest in
attending and helps them meet people with similar interests, so that they can go to
events together.

##How Can I Use It?
Hang Out is easy and intuitive to use! Simply make an account and you're on your way
to finding cool events and meeting people to attend them with!
